Talkyard Coding Style
=====================

Quotes below are from the Linux Kernel coding style [1] (unless otherwise mentioned).

(Old Talkyard code often doesn't follow these coding styles (unfortunately). +
Do not rewrite such old code only to make it follow the coding style.)


=== Simplicity

> _"Avoid tricky expressions."_

Talkyard's code should be _easy to read_. Not necessarily as short as possible.

Sometimes, adding an intermeidate variable and writing out its type, makes
the code simpler to read — and a bit longer. Or adding line breaks,
so the "important" method invokations are visible at _the start of the line_,
or in their own paragraphs, so you find them easily, when glancing at the code.

Talkyard maybe never will use something like Cats (a Sala functional programming library).
Cats makes the code shorter, but _harder to read_?
Example: `EitherT.liftF("a".some)` — what's that — everyone would need to learn
Cats too, not just Scala.


=== Indentation

> _"The whole idea behind indentation is to clearly define where a block
> of control starts and ends. Especially when you've been looking at your screen
> for 20 straight hours, you'll find it a lot easier to see how the indentation
> works if you have large indentations."_

Talkyard: Scala code continuation indentation inside a method: 6 spaces.  +
Indented _statements_: 2 spaces as typical in Scala code.


=== Lines and statements

> _"Don't put multiple statements on a single line unless you have something to hide:"_
> ```
> if (condition) do_this;
>   do_something_everytime;
> ```

200? 400? chars long lines, I have seen, Doing 5-6? 10? different things on the same line.

Talkyard: Only one "interesting" thing should happen per line.

Talkyard: Max 95 chars per line. Then you can have two editor tabs open side by side
on a 14'' 1920 px wide laptop
(1920 is a typical laptop resolution, at least now year 2020).

> _"Do not unnecessarily use braces where a single statement will do."_

This is fine in Talkyard:

```
if (something)
  doTheThing();

otherStuff();
```

_as long as_ after the `if` follows a blank line, or keyword like `else`, `return`
— then you see at a glance that the `if` is just one statement.


=== Names

> _"LOCAL variable names should be short, and to the point. If you have some
> random integer loop counter, it should probably be called i. Calling it
> loop_counter is non-productive, if there is no chance of it being mis-understood"_

Here's how to name things, e.g. database tables, indexes, constraints:
link:naming-notes.


=== Comments

Sometimes people are confused about comments. But the kernel coding style knows:

> _"[Don't explain] HOW your code works [...]
> better to write the code so that the working is obvious [...]_
>
> _[Do tell] people what [the code] does, and possibly WHY it does it"_

There you go: Uppercase `WHY` explain why the code does what it does (when needed).

Also, sometimes you need to tell peolpe what the code does _Not_ do — because there
can be many ways to do something, and you decided against the other ways.
 — whatfor? Is it important that others don't rewrite and
do the stuff in one of those other ways?

Is there something you thought about doing, but avoided? For example, why did
you _Not_ clear a certain cache? What are the reasons you know the cache
is not stale? — If you don't add a comment explaining why, then, a helpful person
might clear the cache, in the future, although was never needed.



=== Avoid exceptions, use Hopefully[_]

With exceptions it's not easy to know about all different exceptions
all code patchs reachable by a method call, might throw.
So the program might misbehave, needlessly, e.g. return 500 Internal Error,
instead of a user friendly _"Please instead try this: ..."_ message.

Look at Rust: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-00-error-handling.html

> _"Rust doesn’t have exceptions. Instead,
> it has the type Result<T, E> for recoverable errors"_

In the same way, Talkyard's Scala code has `Hopefully[T, E]`
when something hopefully returns a `T`
but might fail with a wants-special-hanling problem of type `E`. — In this way,
it's really hard to accidentally forget to special-handle such problems,
and show a user friendly message (instead of Internal Error).
(The name `Result` is used by Play Framework.)

However if the error is "unrecoverable", e.g. a browser sends
json with the wrong field names, then it's ok to throw something
(e.g. `throwBadRequest()`) making the client show an error dialog.



=== Never use Scala's `implicit` parameters

It's not so easy to understand the code when it hides some parameters for you,
so you don't know they're there and change how things work.

(Extending classes with extra methods is fine though, i.e. `implicit class ...`.
Then, everything visible.)



=== Database misc

Use PostgreSQL's `num_nonnulls()` (new since pg v9.6) —
not Talkyard's own old `one_unless_null()`.
